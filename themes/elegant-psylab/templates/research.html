        <h3>Next-Generation Clocking</h3>
        <p>The past three decades have seen dramatic shifts and transitions in the design of CMOS digital integrated circuits, including the “frequency-race”, increasing variability in advanced process technologies, low-voltage operation, and the design of 3D heterogeneous complexes. With the exception of resonant clocking, there have been few significant changes in the state-of-the-art in system clocking. Clock distributions transitioned from clock planes (high performance) to clock trees (lower power) and back to coarse clock meshes (in response to process variability).</p>
