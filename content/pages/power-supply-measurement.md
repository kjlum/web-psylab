### Abstract

Supply-noise measurement techniques are becoming increasingly critical in modern digital design, driven by the trend toward smaller, lower-voltage domains. All-digital measurement modules capable of meeting bandwidth and resolution requirements would enable spatially fine supply voltage measurements across Systems-on-Chip. Existing implementations either use analog techniques, limiting their applicability, or do not meet the increasingly challenging requirements of supply noise measurement. In this paper we discuss a bandwidth-resolution-reconfigurable all-digital system that relies on a dithering technique to achieve a resolution of 2.05 mV at a bandwidth of 6.94 GHz in an industrial 65 nm CMOS process.
