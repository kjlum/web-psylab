## Graduate Student Research Assistant

There are currently openings in the group for creative, dedicated students in Electrical/Computer Engineering to work on a number of current and upcoming projects. Broad areas of interest include:

* Energy-efficient digital & mixed-signal VLSI design
* Circuits for energy scavenging and low-power communication
* Power conversion & regulation, system power management
* Hardware security

## Undergraduate Researchers

The group welcomes enthusiastic, motivated undergraduates from EE/CE/Math/Physics, with a strong grounding in at least one area of integrated system development (e.g., digital/analog design, power systems, computer architecture, IC testing). Students will either take on a directed project to build system modules to be used in research applications, develop test infrastructure (e.g., test PCBâ€™s, FPGA emulators), or team up with graduate students to assist and collaborate on solving challenging research problems.
