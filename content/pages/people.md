<a href="http://www.ee.washington.edu/people/visvesh-sathe/"><b>Professor Visvesh Sathe</b></a> joined the University of Washington Department of Electrical Engineering in 2013. Prior to joining the faculty at the University of Washington, he served as a Member of Technical Staff in the Low-Power Advanced Development Group at AMD, where his research focused on inventing and developing new technologies for next-generation microprocessors. Dr. Sathe has led the research and development effort at AMD that resulted in the first-ever resonant clocked commercial microprocessor. In addition, several of his other inventions have been adopted for use in future-generation microprocessors. His doctoral thesis was selected as the best dissertation in EECS for 2007 and was nominated for the Rackham Graduate School Distinguished Dissertation Award at the University of Michigan. He is a member of the Technical Program Committees of the Custom Integrated Circuits Conference and the International Symposium on Quality Electronic Design.
